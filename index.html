      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <div class="text-wrapper">
        <p>        I’m a PhD candidate and Teaching Associate in the Department of Philosophy at <b>the University of Massachusetts Amherst</b>. My research focuses on the philosophy of science and the metaphysics of higher-level sciences, particularly the psychological and social sciences. My research focuses on questions about scientific autonomy and explanatory pluralism: what makes the social sciences distinct from lower-level sciences like psychology or biology? How should we understand the ontological and epistemological boundaries between disciplines?
</p>
        <p>        Before coming to UMass, I earned my MA from the University of Chicago and taught as an adjunct instructor at several colleges in the Kansas City area. I hold a BA in anthropology and philosophy from the University of Kansas, achieving several honors, notably Phi Beta Kappa.
</p>
        <p>        I also maintain active interests in political philosophy, Early Modern philosophy, and Buddhist philosophy. Outside of academic work, I have a long-standing passion for music and the <a href="art.html">visual arts</a>. I’ve played multiple instruments since childhood and spent years recording and performing in the Kansas City DIY music scene. I also enjoy swimming, weightlifting, cooking, and reading German literature.
